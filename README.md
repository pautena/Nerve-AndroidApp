## Inspiration
We love to Karaoke on Saturday night, but our friend Pau is going to live with his girlfriend in the Netherlands. Because of this, we need a way to Karaoke with him although he's 1.535,5 km far. And now people also can vote for the best singer!

## What it does
Nerve is a mobile app which enables couples to Karaoke in real time although they're not in the same place. Basically you login in the app and send a request to sing a song to your friend, when he accepts you're able to talk until you choose to start, and then, you just need to sing! 

Besides that, you can enter at nerve.gq and see the list of active Karaoke performances, voting if you like them or not. When a vote is emitted, the participants see in their screens the reaction with cool AR stuff like snow and confetti.

## How we built it
We've built the mobile app with Android and the website with Meteor, and used Twilio for the video streaming.

## Challenges we ran into
We've had to learn have to use Twilio because we never used it before. We also had to learn how to connect Android with Meteor. All this crash learning has been so challenging but also a great reward for us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning how to use this technologies we never used and having a new way to Karaoke with Pau when he leave us :D

## What we learned
Twilio and the connection between Meteor and Android

## What's next for NERVE
We are planning to finish NERVE in the next week and launch an alpha release to receive feedback from our friends. If the feedback is good, we'll probably focus on getting it better and iterate it continuously.
